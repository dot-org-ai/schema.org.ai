Ideally, a [[Claim]] description includes enough contextual information to minimize the risk of ambiguity or inclarity. In practice, many claims are better understood in the context in which they appear or the interpretations provided by claim reviews. Beyond [[ClaimReview]], the Claim type can be associated with related creative works - for example a [[ScholarlyArticle]] or [[Question]] might be [[about]] some [[Claim]].
