description: A SpecialAnnouncement combines a simple date-stamped textual information update with contextualized Web links and other structured data.  It represents an information update made by a locally-oriented organization, for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers,  community groups, police, local government. For work in progress guidelines on Coronavirus-related markup see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#). The motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the [Coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic), and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org expect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges from use. In addition to our usual [Github entry](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490), feedback comments can also be provided in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#). While this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like [CAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol), although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover the kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency situation. Several kinds of information can be provided: We encourage the provision of "name", "text", "datePosted", "expires" (if appropriate), "category" and "url" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a value for "category" where possible, most ideally as a well known URL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20\\_coronavirus\\_pandemic" or "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910". For many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property\
