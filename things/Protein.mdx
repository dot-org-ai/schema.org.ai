description: Protein is here used in its widest possible definition, as classes of amino acid based molecules. Amyloid-beta Protein in human (UniProt P05067), eukaryota (e.g. an OrthoDB group) or even a single molecule that one can point to are all of type :Protein. A protein can thus be a subclass of another protein, e.g. :Protein as a UniProt record can have multiple isoforms inside it which would also be :Protein. They can be imagined, synthetic, hypothetical or naturally occurring.

# Protein

Protein is here used in its widest possible definition, as classes of amino acid based molecules. Amyloid-beta Protein in human (UniProt P05067), eukaryota (e.g. an OrthoDB group) or even a single molecule that one can point to are all of type :Protein. A protein can thus be a subclass of another protein, e.g. :Protein as a UniProt record can have multiple isoforms inside it which would also be :Protein. They can be imagined, synthetic, hypothetical or naturally occurring.

## Type Hierarchy

[Thing](Thing.mdx) > [BioChemEntity](BioChemEntity.mdx) > **Protein**



## Properties

See [Schema.org Protein properties](https://schema.org/Protein#properties)

## Usage in Business-as-Code

```typescript
import { $ } from 'sdk.do'
import type { Protein } from 'schema.org.ai'

// Create a Protein
const item: Protein = {
  $type: 'Protein',
  name: 'Example Protein'
}

// Use semantic patterns
await $.Protein.create(item)
const result = await $.Protein.get('item-id')
```
