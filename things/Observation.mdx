# Observation

Instances of the class [[Observation]] are used to specify observations about an entity at a particular time. The principal properties of an [[Observation]] are [[observationAbout]], [[measuredProperty]], [[statType]], [[value] and [[observationDate]]  and [[measuredProperty]]. Some but not all Observations represent a [[QuantitativeValue]]. Quantitative observations can be about a [[StatisticalVariable]], which is an abstract specification about which we can make observations that are grounded at a particular location and time. Observations can also encode a subset of simple RDF-like statements (its observationAbout, a StatisticalVariable, defining the measuredPoperty; its observationAbout property indicating the entity the statement is about, and [[value]] ) In the context of a quantitative knowledge graph, typical properties could include [[measuredProperty]], [[observationAbout]], [[observationDate]], [[value]], [[unitCode]], [[unitText]], [[measurementMethod]].

## Type Hierarchy

**Observation**



## Properties

See [Schema.org Observation properties](https://schema.org/Observation#properties)

## Usage in Business-as-Code

```typescript
import { $ } from 'sdk.do'
import type { Observation } from 'schema.org.ai'

// Create a Observation
const item: Observation = {
  $type: 'Observation',
  name: 'Example Observation'
}

// Use semantic patterns
await $.Observation.create(item)
const result = await $.Observation.get('item-id')
```
