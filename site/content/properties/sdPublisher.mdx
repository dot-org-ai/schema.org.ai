# sdPublisher

Indicates the party responsible for generating and publishing the current structured data markup, typically in cases where the structured data is derived automatically from existing published content but published on a different site. For example, student projects and open data initiatives often re-publish existing content with more explicitly structured metadata. The
<a class="localLink" href="/sdPublisher">sdPublisher</a> property helps make such practices more explicit.
