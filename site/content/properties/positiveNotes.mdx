# positiveNotes

Provides positive considerations regarding something, for example product highlights or (alongside <a class="localLink" href="/negativeNotes">negativeNotes</a>) pro/con lists for reviews.<br/><br/>

The property values can be expressed either as unstructured text (repeated as necessary), or if ordered, as a list (in which case the most positive is at the beginning of the list).
