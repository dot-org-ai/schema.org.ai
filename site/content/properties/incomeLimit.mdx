# incomeLimit

Optional. Income limit for which the incentive is applicable for.<br/><br/>

If MonetaryAmount is specified, this should be based on annualized income (e.g. if an incentive is limited to those making <$114,000 annually):<br/><br/>

<pre><code>{
    "@type": "MonetaryAmount",
    "maxValue": 114000,
    "currency": "USD",
}
</code></pre>

Use Text for incentives that are limited based on other criteria, for example if an incentive is only available to recipients making 120% of the median poverty income in their area.
