# monoisotopicMolecularWeight

The monoisotopic mass is the sum of the masses of the atoms in a molecule using the unbound, ground-state, rest mass of the principal (most abundant) isotope for each element instead of the isotopic average mass. Please include the units in the form '&lt;Number&gt; &lt;unit&gt;', for example '770.230488 g/mol' or as '&lt;QuantitativeValue&gt;.
