# isUnlabelledFallback

This can be marked 'true' to indicate that some published <a class="localLink" href="/DeliveryTimeSettings">DeliveryTimeSettings</a> or <a class="localLink" href="/ShippingRateSettings">ShippingRateSettings</a> are intended to apply to all <a class="localLink" href="/OfferShippingDetails">OfferShippingDetails</a> published by the same merchant, when referenced by a <a class="localLink" href="/shippingSettingsLink">shippingSettingsLink</a> in those settings. It is not meaningful to use a 'true' value for this property alongside a transitTimeLabel (for <a class="localLink" href="/DeliveryTimeSettings">DeliveryTimeSettings</a>) or shippingLabel (for <a class="localLink" href="/ShippingRateSettings">ShippingRateSettings</a>), since this property is for use with unlabelled settings.

## Used on types
