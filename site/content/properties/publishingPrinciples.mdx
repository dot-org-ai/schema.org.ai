# publishingPrinciples

The publishingPrinciples property indicates (typically via <a class="localLink" href="/URL">URL</a>) a document describing the editorial principles of an <a class="localLink" href="/Organization">Organization</a> (or individual, e.g. a <a class="localLink" href="/Person">Person</a> writing a blog) that relate to their activities as a publisher, e.g. ethics or diversity policies. When applied to a <a class="localLink" href="/CreativeWork">CreativeWork</a> (e.g. <a class="localLink" href="/NewsArticle">NewsArticle</a>) the principles are those of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the <a class="localLink" href="/CreativeWork">CreativeWork</a>.<br/><br/>

While such policies are most typically expressed in natural language, sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a <a class="localLink" href="/funder">funder</a>) can be expressed using schema.org terminology.
