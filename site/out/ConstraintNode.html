# ConstraintNode

The ConstraintNode type is provided to support usecases in which a node in a structured data graph is described with properties which appear to describe a single entity, but are being used in a situation where they serve a more abstract purpose. A ConstraintNode can be described using constraintProperty and numConstraints. These constraint properties can serve a variety of purposes, and their values may sometimes be understood to indicate sets of possible values rather than single, exact and specific values.

## Type Hierarchy

**ConstraintNode**

## Direct Subclasses

- **[StatisticalVariable](StatisticalVariable.mdx)**: StatisticalVariable represents any type of statistical metric that can be measured at a place and time

## Properties

See [Schema.org ConstraintNode properties](https://schema.org/ConstraintNode#properties)

## Usage in Business-as-Code

```typescript
import { $ } from 'sdk.do'
import type { ConstraintNode } from 'schema.org.ai'

// Create a ConstraintNode
const item: ConstraintNode = {
  $type: 'ConstraintNode',
  name: 'Example ConstraintNode'
}

// Use semantic patterns
await $.ConstraintNode.create(item)
const result = await $.ConstraintNode.get('item-id')
```
