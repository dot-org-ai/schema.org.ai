# Observation

Instances of the class Observation are used to specify observations about an entity at a particular time. The principal properties of an Observation are observationAbout, measuredProperty, statType, [[value] and observationDate  and measuredProperty. Some but not all Observations represent a QuantitativeValue. Quantitative observations can be about a StatisticalVariable, which is an abstract specification about which we can make observations that are grounded at a particular location and time. Observations can also encode a subset of simple RDF-like statements (its observationAbout, a StatisticalVariable, defining the measuredPoperty; its observationAbout property indicating the entity the statement is about, and value ) In the context of a quantitative knowledge graph, typical properties could include measuredProperty, observationAbout, observationDate, value, unitCode, unitText, measurementMethod.

## Type Hierarchy

**Observation**



## Properties

See [Schema.org Observation properties](https://schema.org/Observation#properties)

## Usage in Business-as-Code

```typescript
import { $ } from 'sdk.do'
import type { Observation } from 'schema.org.ai'

// Create a Observation
const item: Observation = {
  $type: 'Observation',
  name: 'Example Observation'
}

// Use semantic patterns
await $.Observation.create(item)
const result = await $.Observation.get('item-id')
```
