# StoryBrand Framework: schema.org.ai

## 1. Character (The Hero)

**Who is our customer?**

The Developer or Standards Author who needs structured data types for AI applications that don't exist in Schema.org.

**What do they want?**
- Standard vocabulary for AI concepts
- Interoperability between AI systems
- Rich metadata for agents, models, and tools
- Future-proof schemas as AI evolves

## 2. Problem

### External Problem (Tangible)
"Schema.org doesn't have types for AI agents, models, or tools. I'm making up my own schemas."

### Internal Problem (Emotional)
"Without standards, every AI project invents its own vocabulary. Integration is a nightmare."

### Philosophical Problem (Why It's Wrong)
The AI ecosystem needs shared vocabulary just as the web needed Schema.org.

### The Villain
**Fragmentation** - Every project defining AI concepts differently, making interoperability impossible.

## 3. Guide (The Brand)

**Position:** We're extending Schema.org for the AI era with community-driven standards.

**Empathy:** We've struggled with the lack of AI vocabulary too. We built schema.org.ai to solve it for everyone.

**Authority:**
- Extension of Schema.org methodology
- Community governance
- Used by leading AI frameworks
- Evolving with the ecosystem

## 4. Plan (The Path)

### Step 1: Browse
Explore AI-specific types: Agent, Model, Tool, Workflow, Prompt, and more.

### Step 2: Implement
Use the schemas in your application. JSON-LD, YAML-LD, or direct integration.

### Step 3: Contribute
Propose new types. Join the working group. Help shape the standard.

## 5. Call to Action

**Direct CTA:** Browse the Schema

**Transitional CTA:** Read the Spec

## 6. Success (What's at Stake)

**Success looks like:**
- Standard vocabulary across AI
- Easy integration between systems
- Rich, discoverable AI metadata
- Ecosystem interoperability

**Transformation:**
From: Developer inventing custom schemas
To: Developer using shared standards

## 7. Failure (What We Help Them Avoid)

**Failure looks like:**
- Every project with different schemas
- Integration requiring custom adapters
- No discoverability for AI capabilities
- Wasted effort on vocabulary

## 8. Brand Identity

### Voice
Standards-focused, collaborative, authoritative

### Tone
Technical, inclusive, forward-looking

### Key Messages
1. "Schema.org for the AI era."
2. "Standard vocabulary for agents, models, and tools."
3. "Community-driven. Future-proof."
4. "Interoperability through shared schemas."

## 9. Schema Types

### Core Types
- **Agent** - An AI agent with capabilities
- **Model** - An AI model (LLM, embedding, etc.)
- **Tool** - A capability an agent can use
- **Workflow** - A sequence of agent actions
- **Prompt** - A template for model interaction

### Extended Types
- **ModelProvider** - Organization providing models
- **AgentCapability** - What an agent can do
- **ToolDefinition** - Schema for tool parameters
- **WorkflowStep** - Single step in a workflow

## 10. Messaging by Audience

### For Developers
"Stop inventing schemas. Use standardized types for agents, models, and tools."

### For Framework Authors
"Build on schema.org.ai. Your users get interoperability for free."

### For Standards Bodies
"Join the working group. Help define the vocabulary for AI systems."
